: Since July, I'm working on my own sucklessy/minimalist window manager, mainly for fun but also to have a better understanding of X11.

Famicom mods
: I'm thinking about doing another Famicom mod including: AV output, front headphone jack, powered by USB, power led

ScreenOS
: I got a Juniper firewall for cheap, I'm currently learning how to configure it with as a goal to use it as the main entrypoint of my home network.
